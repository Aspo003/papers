# Discussion and Future Work

* iNZight is a simple-to-use tool for exploring/visualising/analysing data
* built for beginners with capabilities to progress to R-driven coding
* easy-to-learn makes it ideal for organisations that need to do specific jobs rarely (i.e., every few months) - more complicated tools are easy to forget
* flexibility of design makes it easy to add/change functionality as demand changes/grows (e.g., survey design)


## Future Work

* better survey handling
* filling the 'code writing' gaps
* connecting to databases (and potentially processing as much as possible within the db)
* Te Reo translation (and flexibility to add more)
* ...
