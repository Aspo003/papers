# Features of iNZight

* Several main groups of functionality:
    * data manipulation (include specifying survey structure)
    * variable manipulation
    * plot control
    * code history

## Data wrangling

* uses 'tidyverse' methods and workflows to perform some data transformation
* all are calls to wrappers inside the 'iNZightTools' package
* the interface allows users to manipulate arguments to the wrapper function - reactive in some cases (i.e., inputs appear/disappear or change values based on previous inputs)
* in many cases, a preview is displayed to help with what can be complex actions, e.g.

* no complex "data tidying" methods - i.e., iNZight expects data to be in rectangular form (but you can move between long/wide formats)


## Graphics and simple data analyses

* all powered by 'iNZightPlots' functions
    * `inzplot()` for graphics
    * `inzsummary()` for simple summary information
    * `inzinference()` for inferencial information and hypothesis testing
* uses the variable type(s) to choose the graph type. Figure x shows the available graph types
* subsetting by 1 or 2 variables is possible/easy/emphasized
    * includes a slider to cycle or 'step' between levels (can add 'motion' to graphs; @citep:Rosling2010;)
* plot features: specific to plot type, users only see what's relevant
* some features (such as colour by) might apply to different plot types (scatter and dot plot, for example) and so selection is retained when switching between these plot types

* inferencial markup of plots
    * normal theory error bars/curves
    * or bootstrap alternative
    * "Comparison intervals" are a way of visually assessing differences - only shown on differences *that should be compared* - bar plot example
    * an approximate tukey thing? details needed here ('iNZightMR' package)

* summary information
    * a simple numeric summary *of the current plot* (philosophy: look first)
* inference information
    * again, default inferences *of the current plot*
    * both normal and bootstrap options
    * gives a list of relevant hypothesis tests (cf. other software which requires you to decide on hypothesis test first)


## Saving code history

* many functions (the wrappers) generate code and attach it to their result
\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
data.filtered <- iNZightTools::filterData(iris, "Species", "Setosa")
cat(code(data.filtered))
# iris %>% dplyr::filter(Species == "Setosa")
\end{lstlisting}

* the iNZight GUI stores the attached code after each action and appends it to the R history 'script'
* provides a record of what was done
* helps students interested in continuing data science/statistics to get familiar with code before writing it themselves (can copy+paste and modify, for example)

## Analysing surveys with iNZight

* survey data:
    * iNZight gets told once, and everything else 'just works'
    * plots use survey methods and alternative plot types (histogram vs dotplot; hex bin plot vs scatter plot)
    * summary/inference all use survey methods to obtain summaries/inferences/hypothesis tests

* supports strata/cluster based survey designs, replicate weights, and post-stratification


## Other modules

* A suite of other (fixed) modules for analying/exploring special types of data
    * time series
    * multiple response
    * maps
* or for doing specific tasks
    * model fitting

* each is its own "reference class" object connecting to one (or more) functions in another package
    * time series -> 'iNZightTS'
    * multiple response -> 'iNZightMR'
    * maps -> 'iNZightMaps'
    * model fitting -> 'iNZightRegression'
* these are mostly wrappers to other functions, or modified versions -> made to work as 'standalone' packages (i.e., without iNZight)
* not fully implemented, but making progress towards modules also code-writing

* also a newer add-on system allowing anyone to write new modules for iNZight (added manually or through our github-hosted repository)
* easier/faster to maintain/update
* useful for e.g., teachers of a specific course
