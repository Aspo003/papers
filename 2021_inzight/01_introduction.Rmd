# Introduction

* Scope out the need for iNZight
* R can be daunting for beginners/students (who may never have used or even see code before)
* Excel @citep:msexcel;, SPSS/etc are rather complex with a not-insignificant learning curve to be able to produce basic exploratative plots and summary statistics
    * Do not provide any kind of a 'pathway' to learning R for data science purposes, either
* Other R-based GUIs:
    * Rcommander @citep:Rcommander;
    * Jamovi @citep:jamovi;
    * ???
* Other tools targeting students:
    * NZGrapher @citep:nzgrapher; uses PHP
* No obvious---simple---point-and-click interfaces for simple data analysis/visualisation that also provide a pathway to more complex, code-driven analyses
