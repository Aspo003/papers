\section{The add-on system}\label{sec:addons}

For most users, the main \pkg{iNZight} program will have all they need to explore, visualise, and perform simple analyses on their data.
Some, however, may require access to special analyses not built in to the base program.
Rather than requiring each new datatype or method to be manually coded into \pkg{iNZight} by the developers, we crafted an \emph{Add on} system allowing anyone to create their own \pkg{iNZight} modules that can connect to new or existing \proglang{R} packages available on \gls{cran} or elsewhere.


Installing existing add-ons is easy.
From the \menu{Module manager} users can add, update, and remove modules from our add-on repository,\footnote{https://github.com/iNZightVIT/addons} a custom URL, or a local file.
In all cases, the file is downloaded to the \code{modules} directory; users can also place files there manually, if desired.
All files in this directory are displayed in the \menu{Advanced} menu of \pkg{iNZight}, and when opened have access to the \pkg{iNZight} interface, including the dataset imported by the user.

The module files themselves describe a single class object which inherits from \class{CustomModule}.
This parent class provides several methods, including the initialization of the module panel in the left-hand-side of the \pkg{iNZight} interface.
Additional properties and methods can be written by the developers of individual modules.
This opens up possibilities for teachers, research groups, or even \proglang{R} package developers themselves to write custom modules to distribute to their audiences.

As an example, \cref{fig:inzight_demest} shows a prototype for an upcoming Bayesian demographic modelling \citep{Zhang_2019} module which will be used by demographers to do small-area estimation.
In the example, we have estimated life expectancies from death count data, which is traditionally a complicated \ldots
Full details for this module will be published once the full version is complete.
